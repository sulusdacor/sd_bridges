	This mod does NOT add any growable soil to place, please use other mods for this.
	
	For more information or questions about compatibility please read the extended description in the forum thread.
	(with patchoperations it should work fine with most mods currently)
	
	Keep in mind that adding "unpassable" terrain screws the AI of pawns.
	-> use at your own disgression ;)
